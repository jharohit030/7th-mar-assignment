    "Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information about how much the values in the dataset vary from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It provides a quick and easy way to describe the spread of a dataset, but it is sensitive to extreme values or outliers. For example, if a dataset contains the values {2, 5, 7, 9, 100}, the range would be 100 - 2 = 98.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Variance: The variance is a measure of how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean. It is calculated by subtracting each value from the mean, squaring the differences, summing them up, and dividing by the total number of values minus one. A higher variance indicates that the values are more spread out, while a lower variance indicates that the values are more clustered around the mean. For example, if a dataset contains the values {2, 5, 7, 9, 11}, the variance would be ((2-7)^2 + (5-7)^2 + (7-7)^2 + (9-7)^2 + (11-7)^2) / (5-1) = 8.\n",

    "3.Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a more intuitive measure of how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean. It is useful because it has the same unit of measurement as the original data and is easier to interpret. A higher standard deviation indicates that the values are more spread out, while a lower standard deviation indicates that the values are more clustered around the mean. For example, if a dataset contains the values {2, 5, 7, 9, 11}, the standard deviation would be the square root of the variance calculated above, which is approximately 2.83.\n",

A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to vary in opposite directions. However, the magnitude of covariance is affected by the scale of the variables, which can make it difficult to compare covariances across different datasets.\n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure of the relationship between two variables. Like covariance, it measures how much the variables vary together, but it also takes into account the scale of the variables. Specifically, correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to +1, with a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation (i.e., the variables are perfectly inversely related), a value of +1 indicating a perfect positive correlation (i.e., the variables are perfectly related), and a value of 0 indicating no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
